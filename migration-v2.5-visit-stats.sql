-- =========================================================
-- X FITNESS Walk-in System v2.5 — Visit stats cache
--
-- Adds visit_count and last_visit_at columns to customers,
-- maintained by a trigger on visits. Backfills existing data.
-- Adds index for sorting by last_visit_at.
--
-- This migration is IDEMPOTENT: safe to run multiple times.
-- It will only create columns/triggers/indexes if they don't
-- already exist, and re-runs the backfill safely.
-- =========================================================

-- 1. Add visit_count and last_visit_at columns to customers ---
alter table customers
  add column if not exists visit_count integer not null default 0,
  add column if not exists last_visit_at timestamptz;

-- 2. Trigger function: maintain visit_count and last_visit_at ---
-- Only counts approved visits (denied attempts shouldn't bump activity).
create or replace function maintain_customer_visit_stats()
returns trigger

      where id = NEW.customer_id;
    end if;
    return NEW;

  elsif (TG_OP = 'DELETE') then

-- 3. Attach the trigger to visits table ---
drop trigger if exists trg_maintain_customer_visit_stats on visits;
create trigger trg_maintain_customer_visit_stats
  after insert or update or delete on visits
  for each row execute function maintain_customer_visit_stats();

-- 4. Backfill existing data ---
-- Recomputes visit_count and last_visit_at for every customer based on
-- existing approved visits. Safe to re-run.
update customers c
set
  visit_count = coalesce(sub.cnt, 0),
  last_visit_at = sub.last_at

  select
    customer_id,
    count(*) as cnt,
    max(visited_at) as last_at
  from visits
  where status = 'approved'
  group by customer_id
) sub
where c.id = sub.customer_id;

-- Customers with zero approved visits don't appear in the subquery; reset
-- them explicitly so the values reflect reality.
update customers
set visit_count = 0, last_visit_at = null
where id not in (
  select distinct customer_id
  from visits
  where status = 'approved' and customer_id is not null
);

-- 5. Indexes for fast sorting on the customer list ---
create index if not exists idx_customers_visit_count_desc
  on customers (visit_count desc);

create index if not exists idx_customers_last_visit_at_desc
  on customers (last_visit_at desc nulls last);

-- =========================================================
-- Done. Verify with:
--   select id, name, visit_count, last_visit_at
--   from customers
--   order by visit_count desc
--   limit 10;
